# financial-variables

A repository that would help me (and others) collect and share financial-variables from IRS and other sources, that would:
- be easy to find
- be accessible to people
- have file formats easily accessible to programs and spreadsheets
- (perhaps APIs as easily accessible to programs as well)
- be up-to-date (automatically scrape data sources and update, or manually updated by this team when announced)
